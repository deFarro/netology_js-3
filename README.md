# Platform game

Game inspired by Super Mario.
Challenge was to create interactive game with realistic physics on vanilla JavaScript.
Behavior driven development approach was used for core elements (tests with HTML interface can be found here: test/index.html).

New levels can easily be created by editing levels.json file, just add proper symbols:

@ - player,
v - fire rain,
= - horizontal fireball,
| - vertical fireball,
o - coin
